# Nibbles & Bits

Nibbles & Bits is an interactive educational model of a 12-bit sequence, displaying controls for modifying its state as well as a view of its interpretation as a signed integer, unsigned integer, and 12-bit color value. The interface and visuals are designed to encourage students to think of binary data as a collection of physical on/off signals, rather than an abstract sequence of 1's and 0's. Playing with this model can help you (or your students) to develop an intuitive sense for fundamental concepts like data types, bitwise operations, and integer overflow.

# Roadmap

Planned features:

## 1 - ByteGates

This will be a separate page that simulates logic gates and bitwise operations, featuring inputs and outputs in a visual/interactive style similar to the Nibbles & Bits model.

## 2 - Content Expansion

Nibbles & Bits will be expanded to display additional data types, including (but not necessarily limited to) floating point values. ByteGates will be expanded to include the same data types, and possibly additional logic gates or operations.

## 3 - GateMaster

This will be a more ambitious and long-term project phase, which will evolve the project from a simple educational model into a tool for high-level logic circuit design. The interface will be in a node-based signal-processing format, similar to that seen in various audio or image processing tools, with customizable nodes representing inputs, outputs, and middleware functions, each possessing their own input and/or output controls.
